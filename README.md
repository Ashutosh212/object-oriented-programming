# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts – Practice & Reuse

Welcome to this repository, where I’m building a **comprehensive reference of OOP concepts** through simple, clear code examples. It’s designed for:

- **Learning & practicing OOP**
- **Reusing class templates across projects**
- **Brushing up before interviews**

---

## What's Inside

This repo contains basic classes that demonstrate **key OOP features**. You can easily **copy, modify, and experiment** with them to understand behavior across different scenarios.

## Concepts Covered

| Concept             | 
|---------------------|
|  Classes & Objects         | 
|  Inheritance (Single/Multiple) | 
|  `super()` usage            | 
|  Instance vs Class variables | 
|  `@classmethod` & `@staticmethod` | 
|  Encapsulation (`_protected`, `__private`) | 
|  Polymorphism (overriding) | 
|  Abstraction  | 
|  Real-world examples |

Next to learn:
1. Garbage Collection
2. Different dunder method like (\_\_repr\_\_)
