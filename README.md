# 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts – Practice & Reuse

Welcome to this repository, where I’m building a **comprehensive reference of OOP concepts** through simple, clear code examples. It’s designed for:

- 📚 **Learning & practicing OOP**
- 🔁 **Reusing class templates across projects**
- 💼 **Brushing up before interviews**

---

## 📌 What's Inside

This repo contains basic classes that demonstrate **key OOP features**. You can easily **copy, modify, and experiment** with them to understand behavior across different scenarios.
